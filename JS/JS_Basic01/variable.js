const accountId = 1234
let accountEmail = "awaghe99@gmail.com"
var accountPass = "123456"

// accountId = 2 , not allowed --- conts value cant be changes


accountEmail = "codewaghre@gmail.com"
accountPass = "654321"


console.log(accountPass)
console.log(accountEmail)
console.log(accountId)

console.table([accountId, accountEmail, accountPass, accountCity])

/*  Summary 

Variable  const, let,var etc
we can change value of Const variable 
we can give memeoery by giving direct name like accountCity is mumbai 
avoid "Var" varibale all time because there is lack of scope and function scope
console. table is helpful when multilple consol is there
